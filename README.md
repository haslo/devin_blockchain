# Blockchain WIP

The Developer's Blockchain.

Implementation in Python. Not yet efficient, but clear and extensible.

Work in Progress. I'll let you know if / when that changes.

## Setup

Venv, recommended:

```
python3 -m venv /venv
source /venv/bin/activate
```

Install the required packages:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Testing

Unit tests are written using pytest. To run the tests, execute the following command:

```
pytest
```

## Blockchain Protocol
