Playbook: Tests for existing blockchain implementation

## Procedure

1. Check out https://github.com/haslo/haslo_blockchain. Ask me for the PAT secret first. You will always use this PAT for the repository.
2. Look at the README.md and the protocol.md for basic pointers and protocol basics.
3. Look at the source code and fill your token windows with knowledge about how things work. The implementation is generally OOP. A block always has a sender (so the transmission specific payload does not need a sender as well), for example. Look at all those things.
4. Globally set your GitHub author and committer name to "ðŸ¤– Devin"
5. Create a new branch feature/just_tests
6. Look at and remember the class structure of haslo_blockchain/tests/test_block.py. Your unit tests must have this structure and use these libraries.
7. Write unit tests for the existing classes, WITHOUT CHANGING THE EXISTING CLASSES, as follows:
   1. Write unit tests for haslo_blockchain/security in haslo_blockchain/tests/security, run them with pytest until they are green. If tests fail, change the tests and not the code until the tests are green.
   2. Write unit tests for haslo_blockchain/transaction_components in haslo_blockchain/tests/transaction_components, run them with pytest until they are green. If tests fail, change the tests and not the code until the tests are green.
   3. Write unit tests for haslo_blockchain/transaction_components/payloads in haslo_blockchain/tests/transaction_components/payloads, run them with pytest until they are green. If tests fail, change the tests and not the code until the tests are green.
   4. Write unit tests for haslo_blockchain/util in haslo_blockchain/tests/util, run them with pytest until they are green. If tests fail, change the tests and not the code until the tests are green.
   5. Write unit tests for haslo_blockchain/util in haslo_blockchain/tests/util, run them with pytest until they are green. If tests fail, change the tests and not the code until the tests are green.
   6. Write unit tests for haslo_blockchain in haslo_blockchain/tests, run them with pytest until they are green. If tests fail, change the tests and not the code until the tests are green.

## Advice and Pointers

Never change a non-test file.
Your PAT allows you to pull and push in the repo. You do not need any other repo operations.
Look up what PATs are and look at the GITHUB_PAT secret instead of looking at gh auth or other unnecessary ways to access repos.

## Specification

Every python file in haslo_blockchain must have a matching set of unit tests. The tests tree must correspond to the package tree. All tests must be green. Zero code files must have changes compared to where you branched off main.
