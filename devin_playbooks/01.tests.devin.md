**Playbook:** Tests for existing blockchain implementation

## Overview

This playbook is used for a specific task in an existing repository.

## What's Needed From User

1. Provide the Personal Access Token for the github repository in question.

## Procedure

1. Check out https://github.com/haslo/haslo_blockchain. You will always use your PAT for the repository. Check what a PAT is if you don't know.
2. Look at the README.md and the protocol.md for basic pointers and protocol basics.
3. Look at the source code and fill your token windows with knowledge about how things work. The implementation is generally OOP. A block always has a sender (so the transmission specific payload does not need a sender as well), for example. Look at all those things.
4. Globally set your GitHub author and committer name to "ðŸ¤– Devin"
5. Create a new branch feature/just_tests
6. Look at and remember the class structure of haslo_blockchain/tests/test_block.py. Your unit tests must have this structure and use these libraries.
7. Write unit tests for the existing classes, WITHOUT CHANGING THE EXISTING CLASSES, as follows:
   - Write unit tests for haslo_blockchain/security in haslo_blockchain/tests/security, run them with pytest until they are green. If tests fail, change the tests and not the code until the tests are green.
   - Write unit tests for haslo_blockchain/transaction_components in haslo_blockchain/tests/transaction_components, run them with pytest until they are green. If tests fail, change the tests and not the code until the tests are green.
   - Write unit tests for haslo_blockchain/transaction_components/payloads in haslo_blockchain/tests/transaction_components/payloads, run them with pytest until they are green. If tests fail, change the tests and not the code until the tests are green.
   - Write unit tests for haslo_blockchain/util in haslo_blockchain/tests/util, run them with pytest until they are green. If tests fail, change the tests and not the code until the tests are green.
   - Write unit tests for haslo_blockchain/util in haslo_blockchain/tests/util, run them with pytest until they are green. If tests fail, change the tests and not the code until the tests are green.
   - Write unit tests for haslo_blockchain in haslo_blockchain/tests, run them with pytest until they are green. If tests fail, change the tests and not the code until the tests are green.

## Advice and Pointers

- Never change a non-test file.
- Your PAT allows you to pull and push in the repo. You do not need any other repo operations. Look up what PATs are and look at the GITHUB_PAT secret instead of looking at gh auth or other unnecessary ways to access repos.
- I expect you to commit early and often, and always push when you have something completed. I will review what you're doing based on that, there is no need for pull requests (I will handle that if appropriate and your PAT does not give you permission for them anyway).
- The README.md tells you how to set up venv. Always use venv.
- Never commit a test that is still red. Never continue to writing the next test unless you have committed the previous test. After writing a test, make sure it's green, then make a commit.

## Specification

Every python file in haslo_blockchain must have a matching set of unit tests. The tests tree must correspond to the package tree. All tests must be green. Zero code files must have changes compared to where you branched off main.
